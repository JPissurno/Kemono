# Kemono
[Kemono.party](https://kemono.party/) is an online paywall scrapper for websites like *Fanbox* (premium version of Pixiv), *Patreon*, and some others, storing up a database of millions of videos, images, and files in general, as well as an artist's posts and updates on their works, upcoming or whatnot.

This software works just like that, except it takes those files from Kemono.party itself. It stores an artist's files and posts localy, keeps track of their works, and much more in the future. Just provide a folder for the files to be downloaded to, as well as the artist handle you want (e.g. their Pixiv ID, artistic name...), and this software will get everything Kemono.party has on that artist for you (heavily configurable).
