# Kemono
[Kemono.party](https://kemono.party/) is an online paywall scrapper for websites like *Fanbox* (premium version of Pixiv), *Patreon*, and some others, storing up a database of millions of videos, images, and files in general, as well as artist's posts and updates on their works, upcoming or whatnot.

This software works just like that, except it takes those files from Kemono.party itself. It stores an artist's files and posts localy, keeps track of their works, and much more in the future.
